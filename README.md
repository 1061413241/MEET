# MEET

This is an official pytorch implementation of our paper "MEET: Multi-band EEG Transformer". In this repository, we provide PyTorch code for training and testing our proposed MEET model. MEET provides an efficient EEG classification framework that achieves state-of-the-art results on several EEG benchmarks such as SEED.
